There are several ways one can deploy our starter project.
This is a non-exhaustive list of a few methods out team has verified to work, with some pro and cons.

# CodeSandbox
With CodeSandBox you can easily fork our starter project and start hacking away.

### How-to
[![Edit mml-starter-project on CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/gdfd4r)

Once your sandbox is initialized, select the 'start: 8080' tab to view the running document as
pictured below:

Hack Away!

### Pros
- Blazing fast setup
- Sign in with GitHub
- Easy to share
- Can be embedded in other pages
- Free

### Cons
- Performance is not ideal for complex documents

# Glitch
Similarly to CodeSandbox, Glitch allows you to remix our starter project and start hacking away.

### How-to
Click the button to create a new sandbox on Glitch.com

[![Remix on Glitch](https://cdn.glitch.me/2703baf2-b643-4da7-ab91-7ee2a2d00b5b%2Fremix-button-v2.svg)](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/remix/skitter-rebel-primrose)

Once your sandbox is initialized, select the preview button at the bottom and you will see the running document in the new window/tab.

### How-to (alternative)
You can also deploy the project directly from the dashboard. To do so, click the New Project button on Glitch.com and select the `Import from GitHub` option. Then, paste the URL of the MML Starter Project repository and click OK.

### Pros
- Blazing fast setup
- Sign in with GitHub
- Easy to share
- Can be embedded in other pages
- Free

### Cons
- Performance probably not ideal for complex documents

# Digital Ocean

### How-to
First of all, create a [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) account if you don't have one and log in.

Then, simply click [this link](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/apps/new?repo=https://github.com/mml-io/mml-starter-project/tree/deploy-digital-ocean)

On the create app page, keep clicking Next until the Review page. Click on Create Resources and the app will be up and running. You will then be given a live url such as https://xxxxx.ondigitalocean.app.
Although doing the above works fine, if you plan to modify the project it is recommended to fork the [starter project on github](https://github.com/mml-io/mml-starter-project) and deploy it as a new app to enable automatic re-deployments.

### Pros
- Fast setup
- More scalable than the previous options
- Automatic re-deployments from github

### Cons
- Not free (though they offer free credit for the first couple of months)
- You can't share the code with others

# Railway

### How-to
Fork the [starter project on github](https://github.com/mml-io/mml-starter-project). Log in on [Railway](https://railway.app/) using your GitHub account.
Click on the New Project button and select the `Import from GitHub` option. Then, paste the URL of the MML Starter Project repository and click OK.

Once the app is up and running, click on Settings and then under Domains click on the `Generate Domain` button. You will be given a live url such as https://xxxxx.up.railway.app.

### Pros
- Fast setup
- Free basic plan
- Fairly scalable
- Automatic re-deployments from github

### Cons
- You can't share the code with others
