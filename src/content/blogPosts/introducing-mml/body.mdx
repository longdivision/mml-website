# Introducing MML: An Open Source Metaverse Markup Language for Immersive 3D Experiences

**Content work in progress. Please check back soon!**

**Metaverse Markup Language (MML)** is an [open-source](https://github.com/mml-io/mml) project that aims to enable the creation and sharing of 3D multi-user experiences in virtual worlds.

MML is a markup language based atop HTML and JavaScript, designed specifically for describing 3D interactive objects and experiences in Metaverse virtual worlds. With MML, creators can develop and share their ideas using a familiar and approachable syntax, taking advantage of the vast ecosystem of libraries, learning resources, and frameworks available for HTML.

```html
<m-cube id="my-cube" color="red"></m-cube>
<script>
    const cube = document.getElementById('my-cube');
    cube.addEventListener('click', () => {
        cube.setAttribute('color', 'blue');
    });
</script>
```
